5 Hackathons conducted as part of my MSc studies

**Course:** GEOG5303M - Creative Coding for Real World Problems

Each hackathon was conducted as a group project in collaboration with an industry partner.

## Descriptions of projects

**Hackathon 1:** Assessing Green Connectivity in Leeds (with Healthy and Sustainable Places Data Service) üå≥

I conducted a network analysis to evaluate how parks in Leeds are connected to each other via public pathways, identifying green spaces that are isolated to suggest opportunities for the creation of green corridors. Green corridors present anthropogenic, biodiversity and environmental benefits.

**Hackathon 2:** Creating a Heat Resilience Index for Property Evaluation (with Martello) üå°

Built a heat resilience index for property evaluation, using Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data in Leeds. Developed Python scripts for cleaning, processing and modelling large spatial datasets. Created a weighted matrix to create resilience and improvement scores informing the property-level climate change reports of the company.


**Hackathon 3:** Assessing High Street Health in Liverpool and Bradford (with Population Health Improvement (PHI) UK) üèôÔ∏è

Delivered spatial analysis to identify high streets and assess their health in Liverpool and Bradford. I used POI data, DBSCAN clustering, buffering and proximity analysis in Python for high street identification. My results were later integrated with demographic and air quality data by my team members, directly informing the client‚Äôs Health Urban Places research. 


**Hackathon 4:** Identifying Opportunities for River Re-Meandering (with Mott MacDonald) üíß

Supported the development of a nature-based solutions mapping tool by identifying opportunities for river re-meandering in the UK. As a team, conducted proximity and sinuosity analyses, developed a watercourse scoring system, while writing reusable Python scripts for spatial data processing and visualisation. Outputs were later integrated into QGIS for stakeholder engagement.

**Hackathon 5:** Creating a Bathing Water Quality Visualization Tool (with the Environmental Agency) üåä

Development of a bathing water quality visualisation tool, to examine environmental factors impacting bacteria levels in Yorkshire‚Äôs bathing waters. My responsibility included creating a clean, structured dataset by calculating lagged rainfall and sewage discharge averages over 24, 48 and 72-hour periods using Pandas. I applied Pearson correlation analyses with SciPy and visualised relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create heatmaps and regression plots.My team mates later integrated my code to create a dashboard.
